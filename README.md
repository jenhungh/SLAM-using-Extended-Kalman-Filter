# SLAM-using-Extended-Kalman-Filter
Implementation of a 2D EKF-SLAM solver in Python to recover the trajectory of the robot and the positions of the landmarks from the control input and measurements.
The measurement (observing the surrounding environment and measuring some landmarks) and control (executes a control input to move) steps are repeated several times.
